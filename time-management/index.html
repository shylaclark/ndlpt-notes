                <h1 id="time-management">Time Management</h1>
<p>Parkinson's Law
Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.</p>
<p>Studentï¿½s Syndrome
A tendency to delay starting an assignment until it is almost too late to get it done on time.</p>
<p>Murphy's Law
If something can go wrong, it will.</p>
<h2 id="backend-load">Backend Load</h2>
<p>Little work on the task in the early part of assigned time followed by colossal effort in the last minute.</p>
<p>Negative outcomes:
    Overshooting the deadline
    Insufficient solution
    Low-quality solution</p>
<h2 id="uniform-load">Uniform Load</h2>
<p>Completing equal parts of the task in equal intervals of time.</p>
<p>Potential problems:
    Accuracy of estimate
    Measure of progress
    No protection from Murphy</p>
<h2 id="frontend-load">Frontend Load</h2>
<p>Doing as much of the task as possible right up front.</p>
<p>Ensures the solution is complete, of good quality, and even if the task is not tangible or the estimate was inaccurate, with most of the task done, the chances of hitting the estimate are very good.</p>
<p>Focus of this technique:</p>
<p>Address the largest, most significant, most complex, or riskiest part of the task first (risk includes the risk of delay).</p>
<p>Time-slice units: Plan periodic targets. Setting these milestones will ensure that the task is proceeding as desired.</p>
<p>Frontend load has the following advantages:
    It reduces the probability of overshooting the deadline (it is still possible to overshoot the deadline if the estimate were inaccurate or if the scope suddenly increased).</p>
<p>It does not require compromises such as reduced quality or sufficiency.</p>
<p>This method provides some insulation against Murphy's Law.</p>
<p>Frontend load counters the limitation of uniform load by:
Addressing the most significant part of the task first balances inaccuracies of estimation
Use of the time-slice units ensures accurate measure of progress</p>
<p>Changing your perspective</p>
<p>When you see a mountain in the distance, it appears as small as a molehill, but when it is mere feet away, it is large. Similarly, when a deadline is far away in time, it is a mere molehill, but when it looms ahead, it appears as a mountain. The mind gives only as much attention to a task as its perceived size. When it is a molehill, the mind ignores it. As the task grows in size as the deadline draws nearer, the mind turns its attention upon it.
To overcome issues arising from this way of thinking, you can use what I call the perspective strategy for efficiency. If you were driving on a deserted highway and you notice a rock in the middle of the road about a mile away, you will not adjust your speed or direction until it looms near you. Similarly, when we look at a task along the time dimension, we will not react to the deadline until it looms large in front of us. People tend to look at tasks along the time dimension. To counter this, let us take a look at the task without any thought to the time available for its completion. Now, the task will grab our attention, we will see its true size, we will attack it, whittle it down to size, then overcome it.</p>
<p>According to Nathaniel Kleitman, the human brain works best with a 20-minute break after 90 minutes of work. Others like Dr. Ernest Rossi have noted the 90-minute cycles, with peak focus for about 45 minutes. Tony Schwartz of the Energy Project recommends three 90-minute sessions in 8 hours of work. The verdict is outï¿½don't work for more than 90 minutes at a time on any task.
What if you do go beyond the 90-minute recommendation? Two things happen. First, your productivity drops sharply. Second, you are a sitting target for the next distraction that waits around the corner.
What is the alternative? The alternative is to deliberately distract yourself. Here is how it works:
1.  Make a list of short tasks (10-15 minutes). This is the "deliberate distractions" list.
2.  Set a timer for 75 minutes
3.  After the timer signals you, bring the main task to a logical pause, that is, a safe state to be interrupted. Make a note of all the things that would enable you to resume the task easily.
4.  Take a 20-minute break.
5.  Complete one of the tasks on your list of deliberate distractions.
6.  Restart the 75-minute timer and resume the main task.
This is a very powerful tool to control brain fatigue.</p>
<p>Exercises</p>
<p>The first exercise in this chapter is a discussion to identify time wasters not listed in earlier sections. This discussion serves to extend the list and also to make the students aware of and be alert for potential time traps.
The second exercise in this chapter is to identify one occasion in your lives when you did not meet a deadline, identify reason(s) why things took longer than assigned or estimated, discover how you could have recognized the time trap(s), and come up with strategies to avoid the time trap(s) or recover from it (them) when it (they) occur(s).
The third exercise is an on-going activityï¿½to keep track of time wasters and devise strategies for avoidance and recovery.</p>
<p>From Stressaholics book:</p>
<p>Time management experts have estimated that it can take up to 20 minutes to recover from a distraction, with more complex tasks taking a greater toll on what's called switch cost ï¿½the time taken to adjust mental settings and competition due to carrying over mental controls from the previous task.</p>
<p>Why Focus is So Important</p>
<p>Without focus, tasks end up getting stretched out over a very long period of time. Distractions that break our focusï¿½or prevent us from ever getting itï¿½end up costing us more than the time they take away. If you have to constantly stop and start, youï¿½ll be forced to go at a much slower speed overall.</p>
<p>Not Easy to Get Into Focus Mode</p>
<p>If you want to get into a focused mode, you have to realize that it isnï¿½t an instant switch that you can flip. To get into it, you have to push through the initial pain of contorting your mind to a single task. You have to realize that the pain and discomfort is only temporary and doesnï¿½t really last that long.</p>

<p>Planning Technique</p>
<p>Quarterly
ï¿½   Choose a project to do over next three months.
ï¿½   List all the steps/tasks necessary to achieve it.
ï¿½   Assign a time value to each step.
ï¿½   Put steps in sequential order.</p>
<p>Monthly
ï¿½   Print out calendar for the month.
ï¿½   Take items from quarterly outline and schedule them into the calendar.</p>
<p>Weekly
Make Kanban board with these columns:
-   To Do
-   Monday
-   Tuesday
-   Wednesday
-   Thursday
-   Friday
-   Done
-   Next Week (optional)</p>
<p>Vacations from Planning</p>
<p>Sometimes good to spend a week just coasting at work, where you just work on whatever you want and you donï¿½t measure your productivity.</p>
<p>Quotas</p>
<p>This idea is the core of the system. You donï¿½t leave yourself any choice but to do what you set out to do. In your mind, failure canï¿½t be an option.</p>
<p>The whole system falls apart if your commitment is weak, so you have to choose attainable and maintainable quotas.</p>
<p>Well, if youï¿½re having trouble with multitasking during the day because there are multiple         tasks you have to get done, youï¿½ll probably be better off learning how to batch those tasks and work on a series of related tasks all at         once rather than splitting them up throughout the day.</p>
<p>Time Wasters</p>
<p>I found that by replacing the time I was spending watching TV with working on this project that I enjoyed, I was getting a lot more done and I was feeling better about it.</p>
<p>ï¿½Landminesï¿½
TV
Social media
Emails
Meetings
Cooking
Videogames
Coffee breaks</p>
<p>Track your time to see where you are ï¿½wastingï¿½ it.</p>
