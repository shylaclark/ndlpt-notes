# Canvas

* Designs should have a margin of at least 2".
* Why do some designs have huge margins? So the stitcher has more flexibility.
* Stitch painting is not necessary, and it's significantly more time-consuming for the painter, resulting in a more expensive canvas.[[source]](https://napaneedlepoint.com/about-needlepoint/2016/06/19/quality-needlepoint-canvases/)
