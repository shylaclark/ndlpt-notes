# Fibers

## Silk


## Silk & Ivory
* [Silk & Ivory](https://www.brownpaperpackages.com/Silk-and-Ivory/Default.asp) is my favorite fiber right now. It's thick, strong, plush, and bouncy with excellent coverage. 
* Available in 244 colors, with many more to come.
* Canvas sizes: #13, #14, #16, or #18
* Needle size: 24

## Perle cotton
* DMC 5 was the first fiber I ever stitched with. It's very affordable and comes in tons of colors. It's easy to find and can be picked up at Michaels and Joanns. The thread frays and weakens easily.
* Canvas sizes: #18
* Needle size: 24 and 26
