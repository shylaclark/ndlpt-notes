## Silk

### [Splendor by Rainbow Gallery]()
We recommend this .  The thread comes in three bundles of 4 plies, that makes it easy to identify groups of plies.   The twist on each strand is higher than other strandable silks.   Available on a 8 yard card.

## Cotton

### [DMC Pearl Cotton Size 5 (Medium)](https://www.dmc.com/us/pearl-cotton-size-5-304-colors-available-9002043.html)
The first fiber I ever stitched with. It's very affordable and comes in tons of colors. It's easy to find and can be picked up at Michaels and Joanns. The thread frays and weakens easily. The higher the thread size, the finer/thinner the thread.
